# Simple Todo App

Working on a simple to do app.

## Functionality

This is a simple to-do list app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can add tasks, check them off when they're done, and delete them if needed. There's also a "Clear All" button if you want to wipe the whole list.

Tasks are saved in your browser using localStorage, so they’ll still be there if you refresh or come back later. Everything updates in real time—no page reloads or anything like that.

The layout’s responsive and works fine on smaller screens. The code's written in JS and broken into functions to keep things organized.

## Technology

HTML5: Defines the structure and semantic layout of the application, including form inputs, task list elements, and buttons.

CSS3: Styles the application layout, including spacing, colors, font choices, and hover states. Uses Flexbox for responsive task list alignment.

JavaScript (ES6+): Handles DOM manipulation, form validation, event listeners, and dynamic updates to the task list. Core functionality includes:

    Adding tasks

    Marking tasks as complete/incomplete

    Deleting individual tasks

    Clearing the entire task list

LocalStorage API: Stores tasks persistently in the user's browser. Data remains intact across sessions without requiring a backend.

Event Delegation: Used for efficiently handling events on dynamic task elements.

Modular JavaScript: Script is organized using functions for readability and maintainability.

## Deployment
